# bg2 engine - C++ API

bg2e is a graphic engine oriented to the creation of graphic applications. It is designed to cover some features that graphic engines for videogames do not have:

- Native integration with operating system APIs, especially with user interface elements.
- Load and store scenes and 3D models at runtime: no need to pack the scenes together with the executable application.
- Lightweight libraries: you don't need to distribute hundreds of megabytes of resources with the application.
